	Add the new organizer property to your Event items on https://www.bacds.org/

	Many events are now being hosted in virtual format, without a venue or location. In order to enable event organizers to provide more context to potential attendees, Google has added a new, optional property to Event items: organizer.

	This new property is especially important for online events, where there isn't any venue information. When using this property, we recommend specifying at minimum the organizer.name and organizer.url subproperties.

	Need more help?

	•	Ensure that your Event items follow both the Event developer guidelines and Google's structured data guidelines and policies.
	•	Read our Events FAQ page for answers to commonly asked questions.
	•	Use the Rich Results Test to test your Event code. Make sure that you use a unique URL for each Event.
	•	Ask questions in our forum for more help - mention message type [WNC-20119346].


load/load_all should be one function

update() needs to change the date_updated column

break out band into a separate table, "musos", many-to-one, and keep the
current "band" column as an advert blurb

rename type to style, loc to venue

all DateTime-now needs to change to
DateTime->now(time_zone => "America/Los_Angeles")'

check that dancefinder.pl is decoding spaces %20 in params correctly
have load_all remove any % from string in LIKE queries

make some of these LIKE queries ignore case
