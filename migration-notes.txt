getleaders.pl as a callerlist, comma-separated:
     my @clst = split(/, /, $leader);
        foreach my $i (@clst) {
            $leaderhash{$i} = $i if ! $leaderhash{$i};
        }
screen for that manually afterwards

crazy comma-splitting in getmusos.pl isn't reflected in migration--do manually?

band list in migrate-bands.pl are out of date ?
event_talent_map is empty
no "SPECIAL" styles were migrated, wtf?
